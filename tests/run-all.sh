# Every in-plugin agent name the harness itself dispatches or documents dispatching must
# be harness:-qualified: a bare name (e.g. 'code-architect') only resolves inside this
# plugin's own repo, never for a plugin consumer's session (verified by a live probe).
# The delimiter-adjacency in this pattern is what does the exclusion: `harness:code-architect`
# has a colon, not a quote/backtick, immediately before the name, so it never matches; only a
# bare delimited literal does. Covers code literals ('/") AND prose mentions (backticks), and
# scans the consumer-facing docs outside the plugin too. Agent frontmatter `name:` fields are
# unquoted and stay bare, so they never match. Revert any one fix to prove this fails.
